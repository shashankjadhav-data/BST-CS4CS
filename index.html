        I will write a paragraph for each methodology of SDLC. There are many of them. My suggestion and reason are as
        follows
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Waterfall: The Waterfall methodology is one of the earliest and most traditional SDLC approaches. It
                follows a linear and sequential process where each phase—requirements gathering, design, implementation,
                testing, deployment, and maintenance—is completed before moving to the next. This approach is ideal for
                projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, as it emphasizes thorough
                documentation and a structured process. The key advantage of the Waterfall model is its simplicity and
                clear milestones, making it easy to manage and understand. However, its rigidity is a significant
                drawback, as it doesn’t accommodate changes easily once a phase is completed. This methodology works
                best for projects like construction or government software where the scope is fixed and predictable.
            </li>
            <li>Agile: Agile is a flexible and iterative SDLC methodology designed to adapt to changing requirements and
                foster collaboration between cross-functional teams. It divides the project into small, manageable
                iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Agile emphasizes continuous delivery of working
                software, customer feedback, and collaboration over strict adherence to a predefined plan. Its main
                advantages include increased adaptability, faster time to market, and higher customer satisfaction.
                However, it may lead to scope creep if not managed effectively and requires significant involvement from
                stakeholders. Agile is best suited for dynamic projects like app development or software startups where
                requirements may evolve rapidly.</li>
            <li>Incremental: The Incremental methodology divides the development process into smaller, manageable
                modules called increments. Each increment builds on the previous one, gradually adding functionality
                until the complete system is delivered. This approach allows teams to deliver functional software early
                and make adjustments based on user feedback. Its main advantages are flexibility, faster delivery of
                working software, and reduced project risks. However, it may result in integration challenges as
                increments are combined. Incremental is best suited for projects where early delivery of critical
                features is a priority, such as web or mobile app development.</li>

        Among so many methodlogies the ones that are in the AGILE classification are better. Among Agile SDLC methods, I
        also have a few suggestions
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile methodologies are highly adaptive to changing requirements, making
                them ideal for projects where the scope is uncertain or evolves over time. Unlike rigid models like
                Waterfall, Agile promotes iterative progress and allows teams to pivot based on customer feedback.</li>
            <li>Continuous Delivery: Agile emphasizes delivering functional increments of the product frequently,
                ensuring that stakeholders see tangible progress early and consistently. This leads to faster
                time-to-market and reduces risks associated with delayed feedback.</li>
            <li>Collaboration and Communication: Agile fosters close collaboration between cross-functional teams and
                stakeholders. Practices like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives ensure continuous
                communication, transparency, and alignment of goals.</li>
            <li>Improved Customer Satisfaction: Agile methodologies prioritize customer feedback and involve
                stakeholders throughout the development process, resulting in a final product that closely aligns with
                user needs and expectations.</li>

        I have used css in the webpage and there are 3 ways to include css in a webpage as follows
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Inline CSS: CSS is written directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. This method is
                used for applying styles to a specific element, but it is not recommended for large projects due to poor
                maintainability. </li>
            <li>Internal CSS: CSS rules are defined within a &lt;style&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; section of the
                HTML document. This approach is useful when styling is specific to a single webpage. </li>
            <li>External CSS: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using a
                &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. This method is ideal for reusability and maintainability
                across multiple webpages. </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        The reason CSS was used in the page are
        <ol type="1">
            <li>To Enhance Layout and Design: CSS allows precise control over the page layout, ensuring a visually
                appealing design. In this webpage, features like padding, margins, flexbox, and borders help create a
                well-structured form and organized content.</li>
            <li>Improved User Experience: By using CSS for styling, elements such as input fields, labels, and buttons
                are spaced and aligned properly, making the form easy to read and interact with. This enhances usability
                and improves the overall user experience.</li>
            <li>Consistency in Styling: CSS helps maintain consistent styling throughout the page, ensuring uniform
                alignment, spacing, and colors. This creates a cohesive design for the webpage.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        We also use Javascript in webpage development. The main reasons are as follows
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Interactivity: JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic and interactive features like form validation,
                dropdown menus, sliders, and modals. It enhances user engagement by allowing real-time updates and
                interactions without requiring a page reload.</li>
            <li>Client-Side Processing: JavaScript executes directly in the user’s browser, reducing server load and
                improving performance. It handles tasks like input validation and data manipulation efficiently on the
                client side, providing a smoother user experience</li>
            <li>Integration with HTML and CSS: JavaScript works seamlessly with HTML and CSS, allowing developers to
                manipulate DOM elements dynamically. This enables features such as showing/hiding elements, changing
                styles, and updating content based on user actions.</li>
            <li>Versatility and Extended Functionality: JavaScript supports libraries (like jQuery) and frameworks (like
                React, Angular, and Vue), enabling the development of advanced web applications, animations, and
                seamless user interfaces. It can also interact with APIs for data exchange, making it essential for
                modern web development.</li>
            <li>Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring that
                interactive features and dynamic content work consistently across different platforms and devices. This
                makes it an essential tool for building accessible and user-friendly websites.</li>
