        I will write a paragraph for each methodology of SDLC. There are many of them. My suggestion and reason are as
        follows
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Waterfall: The Waterfall methodology is a traditional approach. 
                It’s a linear and sequential process where each phase has its own objective. 
                The phases are – Requirement, Gathering, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance. 
                You start from the top i.e., Requirement and end at the bottom i.e., Maintenance, one could think of it as a down flowing flowchart. 
                Waterfall approach is very ideal where the project is very structured with defined requirements. 
                Waterfall SDLC also incorporates well structured documentation of the whole project, with clear milestones. 
                A major drawback of this process would be accommodating changes/updates in between the phases. 
                This SDLC is very much suited for fixed scopes like for government projects.
            </li>
            <li>B.	Agile: Agile is a very flexible SDLC, this methodology works in such a way, where incorporating changes are much easier. 
                Agile is very intuitive, it enables collaborations between cross-team setting. 
                Its objective is to delivery a continuous working software with customer feedback and collaboration according to a defined plan. 
                Its main advantage as mentioned above is adapting to changes, faster implementation to market and high customer satisfaction. 
                Agile is best suited for projects wherein the requirements evolve/changes quickly.</li>
            <li>C.	Incremental: This SDLC divides the whole scope into small or bits of managerial modules, which are called increments. 
                This enables to build the software in bits where functionality or features are added gradually, which will ultimately result in software/system being delivered. 
                This SDLC helps the developers to make changes easily and incorporate them easily so that the software/system can be delivered early, with adjustment to user feedback. 
                Main advantages of this SDLC are flexibility, less risks and faster delivery for a functioning software.
                 It may introduce some challenges as most of the changes or functionality as added incrementally or one by one. 
                 Incremental is ideal for web or mobile development and critical projects which are on priority for early delivery. </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        Among so many methodlogies the ones that are in the AGILE classification are better. Among Agile SDLC methods, I
        also have a few suggestions
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile are highly effective for adapting changes, which makes them ideal for projects where the scopes are changing or uncertain. 
                Whereas, a waterfall model which are more rigid in nature. Agile promotes cross functioning team collaborations, changes according to customer feedback. </li>
            <li>Continuous Delivery: Agile promotes delivering the system over functional increments of the software. 
                This enables the stakeholders/customers to observe the progress consistently. 
                This leads to a faster delivery to market, reduced risks. </li>
            <li>Collaboration and Communication: As mentioned earlier, Agile promotes cross – functional team collaboration with teams and the parties involved. 
                Daily meetings, sprint planning, continuous communication promotes transparency and correct alignment with the objectives.  </li>
            <li>Improved Customer Satisfaction: Agile efficiently utilizes customer feedback by involving stakeholders throughout the development process, which results in a more refined product which is more in line with the customer’s requirement. 
                This greatly satisfies the customer.</li>

        In this software development and application course of SRH we learn the following
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Comprehensive SDLC Practices: This course covers the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
                This will help us to understand concepts like Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, etc., for real world application. 
                This knowledge would enable us choose which SDLC method is best suited according to the scope of the project. </li>
            <li>Programming and Application Development: : In this section of the course, we get hands on experience with programming languages, 
                tools and framework. This knowledge will help us to design meaningful systems. We also learn about the importance of scalability, 
                efficient systems and user-friendly applications.</li>
            <li>Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills:This part of the course enables us the to use our 
                critical thinking for problem solving. This will help us to build software solutions according to the use of the user. </li>
            <li>Team Collaboration and Project Management: : This part of the course helps us students to collaborate in groups to 
                work efficiently, effective communication, manage timelines and ensuring smooth development of process for the successful 
                deployment of the product. </li>

        I have used css in the webpage and there are 3 ways to include css in a webpage as follows
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Inline CSS: This type of CSS is written directly within the HTML, using the style attribute. 
                This method is useful for applying styling a particular element. This is not suitable for large projects since 
                it very to maintain, within a broader scope.  </li>
            <li>Internal CSS: This CSS is defined user the &lt;style&gt; tag, which resides inside the &lt;head&gt; section 
                of the HTML. This is useful when one would apply a particular styling to a single webpage. 
            <li>External CSS: This is one the most used method of applying CSS. A separate .css file is linked with the main HTML document 
                using &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. This method is great for styling multiple pages 
                where the styling can be used repeatedly.  </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        The reason CSS was used in the page are
        <ol type="1">
            <li>To Enhance Layout and Design: CSS allows us to control the page layout, which helps the developer to 
                design an appealing styling for the page. In this webpage, padding, margins, flexbox and borders is used 
                to maintain a structured form and organize the content effectively. </li>
            <li>Improved User Experience: CSS is mainly used for styling and positioning of elements, such as input fields, 
                labels and buttons, which makes it easy to interact for the user. This greatly enhances the user experience.</li>
            <li>Consistency in Styling: CSS helps in maintaining a consistent styling throughout the page, which ensures uniform alignments, 
                spacing, colours, etc. </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        We also use Javascript in webpage development. The main reasons are as follows
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Interactivity: JavaScript enables us to create interactive a dynamic features like form validation, manus, dropdowns,
                 sliders, modals, real-time updates, etc. This generates positive interaction with the user. </li>
            <li>Client-Side Processing:JavaScript enables us to execute directly on to the user’s web browser, which improves 
                performance. Tasks like data validation and input validation becomes very efficient, which provides a smooth user 
                experience.</li>
            <li>Integration with HTML and CSS: JavaScript works seamlessly with technologies like HTML and CSS, allowing us to manipulate 
                the DOM elements dynamically. This will help us to update all of the content according the user interaction.</li>
            <li>Versatility and Extended Functionality: JavaScript supports various libraries like jQuery and various frameworks such as 
                Angular, React, Vue, etc. This enables us for a variety of advance level development for application, animation and seamless 
                user interface. This will also enable us to interact with APIs which is an integral part of web development. </li>
            <li>Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all of the web browsers, which makes it a very effective 
                technology in web development. Features like dynamic content and interactive features work 
                consistently across all of the platforms.</li>
